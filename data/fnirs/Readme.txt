This dataset consists of 474 trials from seven different subjects (from Buffalo Study # 2). The associated days, trial numbers of each day, trial time of each trial, performance scores and FLS scores can be obtained from the corresponding excel sheet (data_with_scores.xlsx).

Each file of 'Datapoints in txts' folder refers to each trial performed by a subject. The file has multivariate time series (N = 12) from the six PFC channels, each channel having two time series of HbO and HbR concentration changes.

Nomenclature: L03_NIRS-2019-08-12_004_trial1:
L03 = Subject L3
2019-08-12 = Date when trial was performed
trial01 = trial number of that day for that subject
